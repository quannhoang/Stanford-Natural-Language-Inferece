Sentences sentimental comparision using Recurrent Neural Network
Date: 04/15/2020
Project description: building a simple neural network to analyze and compare the sentimental of two sentences (in English). The network takes two sentences as input and determine if two sentences are contradicting, entailing or neutral.
Data example:

Sentence 1: A land rover is being driven across a river
Sentence 2: A sedan is stuck in the middle of a river
Label: Contradiction

Methodology: Data processing, Deep learning, natural language processing, recurrent neural network.
Tools: pandas, numpy, Keras.
Dataset: Standford Natural Language Inferece (SNLI) Corpus.
