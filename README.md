Sentences sentimental comparision using Recurrent Neural Network<br/>
Date: 04/15/2020<br/>
Project description: building a simple neural network to analyze and compare the sentimental of two sentences (in English). The network takes two sentences as input and determine if two sentences are contradicting, entailing or neutral.<br/>
Data example:<br/><br/>

Sentence 1: A land rover is being driven across a river<br/>
Sentence 2: A sedan is stuck in the middle of a river<br/>
Label: Contradiction<br/>

Methodology: Data processing, Deep learning, natural language processing, recurrent neural network.<br/>
Tools: pandas, numpy, Keras.<br/>
Dataset: Standford Natural Language Inferece (SNLI) Corpus.<br/>
